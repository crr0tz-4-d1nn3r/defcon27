Threat Hunting With The Elastic Stack,Friday,09:00,"Savoy Ballroom, The Flamingo Hotel",240,workshop,"@CyberPraesidium, @politoinc","With all new logs and revamped material from our 2018 workshop, this year's hands-on training will walk attendees through leveraging the open source ELK (Elastic) stack to proactively identify malicious activity hiding within diverse data sets. The basic tools and techniques taught during this class can be used to investigate isolated security incidents or implemented at scale for continuous monitoring and threat hunting. Attendees will be provided with access to a preconfigured ELK cluster and extensive sample logs containing malicious events waiting to be discovered on a simulated enterprise network. New for this year, attacker artifacts will be mapped to the MITRE ATT&CK Framework and tagged accordingly in the provided logs to help demonstrate the value of log enrichment, showcase both common and novel real-world attacker TTPs, and leverage a methodological approach to adversary and anomaly detection. Emphasis will be placed on live demos and practical training exercises throughout. The training will conclude with a friendly CTF tournament to give attendees the opportunity to collaborate and compete on teams in order to put their learning into practice and win some prizes.","@CyberPraesidium brings over 12 years of diverse experience in cyber security, IT, and law.

Olaf has spoken at MITRE ATT&CKcon, ISF Live, Splunk Live, BlackHat EU Arsenal.In order to become a superhero, able to hunt for bad in your environment you first need some great powers. Starting blind, you need means to listen. I will introduce a modular Sysmon configuration to cover your Windows environment, mapped extensively to the ATT&CK framework.By using the ATT&CK framework as a basis for hunting the likelihood of catching at least part of the attackers trail is significantly increased. To make use of this rich data source I will guide you through a Threat Hunting methodology in an application built to do just this, which will guide your investigation along all covered ATT&CK techniques.",@olafhartong is a person of many interests with a passion for defensive security and data.,,,,,
Malware Traffic Analysis Workshop,Friday,14:00,"Valley Of Fire 1, The Flamingo Hotel",240,workshop,@thezachw,"This workshop is an introduction to building first-class host instrumentation capabilities with open-source technologies supported by leading security practitioners. Learn the ins and outs of Facebook’s osquery agent, exposing information from hundreds of sources across the major operating systems (Mac, Windows, and Linux). See how to tie this together across the infrastructure with Kolide’s Fleet. Throughout the workshop we will interact with osquery in example scenarios in order to build hands-on experience with these tools. We will begin with a dive into the capabilities of osquery. A brief introduction to the structured query language (SQL) used in osquery will be provided. Using this query language, we will learn to extract basic data, and move on to more advanced ways to associate data across subsystems. We will discuss the scheduled query facilities of osquery and how these can be tied into a logging and alerting pipeline. When we have built some familiarity with osquery, we will look at how to utilize these capabilities across the managed infrastructure. We will cover how to manage configurations and live query individual and groups of hosts with Kolide Fleet. The discussion of Fleet will be rounded out with an introduction to the command line interface, with suggestions for how to integrate with automation and source-control workflows.","@thezachw has been involved with osquery since the earliest design documents in 2015. He has brought his extensive experience to the delivery of core features such as AWS logging and syslog consumption in osquery, as well as the development Kolide Fleet, the most popular open-source osquery Fleet manager. These days he can be found cheerfully helping out users in the osquery community, or developing features for Fleet. As the founder of Dactiv LLC, he consults with technical organizations to reap the benefits of Fleet and osquery.",,,,,

MEDIC! Malware Response 101 From The Trenches,Friday,14:00,"Valley Of Fire 2, The Flamingo Hotel",120,workshop,@krypt3ia,"Many of you out there may be in the information security field but how many of you know how to respond to a phishing and malware outbreak? It seems to be a common theme in companies that the ideal is that tools will be the end all be all in mitigating threats but the reality is that many times one will find themselves staring at a screen of alerts about malware and phishing waves coming in and no one really knows how to approach reversing the malware quickly and responding appropriately on a shoe string, which, many companies sadly find themselves doing. This workshop will show you how to triage a malware situation using tools and techniques easily found online. With a little know how and understanding of how malware works outside of the exotic APT you hear about, you too can learn how to respond without the benefit of a huge budget for security tools and even perhaps enough responders.","@krypt3ia is a security professional with over 13 years experience specializing in areas such as DFIR Ethical Hacking/Pen Testing, Social Engineering Information, Security Auditing, ISO27001, Threat Intelligence Analysis, Steganography Application and Detection.",,,,,
