Ecosystem-Level Authentication as an Enhancement to Perimeter-Based Security in Email,Saturday,12:00,26th Floor Bally's,60,packet hacking village,"Peter Goldstein, CTO and Co-Founder of Valimail","Email presents unique challenges to security professionals and unique opportunities for hackers, particularly in the cloud era. Perimeter-based security approaches are incomplete because of the distributed, decentralized nature of the internet's email infrastructure and its lack of widely accepted, standardized identity mechanisms. Yet most email security professionals still take an exclusively medieval ""protect the castle"" approach to messaging defense, without considering other layers or modes of defense. This talk will show how that strategy can fail, and will include details on a number of case studies that show how phishing campaigns can cause economic and reputational damage on a large scale by leveraging the distributed, cloud-based nature of email. It will also outline an emerging model for cloud-based, federated security that is based on civil society rather than medieval fortress defense.","Peter Goldstein is the CTO and co-founder of Valimail.

Even if DNSSEC is fully implemented, an attacker can still poison various unsigned records in the response. These types of attacks are difficult but have been considered feasible over IPv4, but impossible over IPv6.

Generating Personalized Wordlists With NLP by Analyzing Tweets,Saturday,15:00,26th Floor Bally's,30,packet hacking village,"Utku Sen, R&D Lead at Tear Security","Adversaries need to have a wordlist or combination-generation tool while conducting password guessing attacks. To narrow the combination pool, researchers developed a method named ""mask attack"" where the attacker needs to assume a password's structure. Even if it narrows the combination pool significantly, it can be still too large to use for online attacks or offline attacks with low hardware resources.

(Re)Thinking Security Given the Spectre of a Meltdown (hold my beer),Saturday,16:00,26th Floor Bally's,60,packet hacking village,"Jeff Man, InfoSec Curmudgeon","Have you ever noticed that much of the mission of cyber- and information security professionals seems to be focused on vulnerabilities? Have you ever heard of the risk equation? Perhaps you are familiar with one or more versions that help you derive the risk to your organization (sometimes referred to as residual risk). I have been wondering for a while how to suggest to our industry that there is perhaps TOO much focus on vulnerabilities and not enough attention or focus on the other elements that derive the standard risk equation. The recent disclosure of Meltdown/Spectre introduced a ""perfect storm"" scenario where the vulnerability wasn't easy to patch or fix, and the solution seemed to be break things. This created a situation where the ""security solution"" wasn't simply to apply the patch - and that left many organizations scrambling to figure out how to deal with this example of a persistent vulnerability. This is a great example of what I've wanted to discuss for a while - what else should we focus on in terms of security if/when the vulnerabilities still remain. Interested? Intrigued?
