Pwning Serverless Applications,Thursday,10:00,"Flamingo, Red Rock V",240,workshop,"Abhay Bhargav Founder, we45,Nithin Jois ,Tilak Thimmappa ","Serverless Technology (Functions as a Service) is fast becoming the next ""big thing"" in the world of distributed applications. Especially with widespread support from cloud vendors, this technology is going to only become more influential. However, like everything else, Serverless apps are subject to a a wide variety of attack possibilities, ranging from attacks against access control tech like Function Event Injection, JWTs, to NoSQL Injection, to exploits against the apps themselves (deserialization, etc) escalating privileges to other cloud components.

This workshop is replete with hands-on labs and presents a red-team perspective of the various ways in which testers can discover and exploit serverless applications to compromise sensitive information, and gain a deeper foothold into cloud database services, IAM services and other other cloud components. The workshop also features real-world serverless implementations, specifically to highlight the lack of frameworks, tooling and security mechanisms that makes life much harder for developers to implement, therefore, easier for attackers to compromise","Abhay Bhargav Abhay Bhargav is the Founder of we45, a focused Application Security Company.

Introduction to Cryptographic Attacks,Thursday,10:00,"Flamingo, Red Rock VIII",240,workshop,Matt Cheung Hacker,"Using cryptography is often a subtle practice and mistakes can result in significant vulnerabilities. This workshop will cover many of these vulnerabilities which have shown up in the real world. This will be a hands-on workshop where you will implement the attacks after each one is explained. I will provide a VM with Python dependencies and skeleton code included so you can focus on implementing the attack. A good way to determine if this workshop is for you is to look at the challenges at cryptopals.com and see if those look interesting, but you could use in person help understanding the attacks. While not a strict subset of those challenges, there is significant overlap.","Matt Cheung Matt Cheung started developing his interest in cryptography during an internship in 2011. He worked on implementation of a secure multi-party protocol by adding elliptic curve support to an existing secure text pattern matching protocol. Implementation weaknesses were not a priority and this
concerned Matt. This concern prompted him to learn about cryptographic attacks from Dan Boneh's crypto 1 course offered on Coursera and the
Matasano/cryptopals challenges. From this experience he has given talks and workshops at the Boston Application Security Conference and the DEF CON
Crypto and Privacy Village.", Intermediate, Students should be comfortable with modular arithmetic and the properties of XOR.

Hacking Wi-Fi for Beginners,Thursday,10:00,"Flamingo, Red Rock III",240,workshop,"Alex Hammer Hacker,Penelope 'Pip' Pinkerton ","Wi-Fi attack capability is an important part of any hacker's toolbox. Wi-Fi extends the perimeter of a supposedly-secure network to sidewalks, parking lots, and trendy coffee shops. But many hackers don't know how Wi-Fi is simultaneously both easy and difficult to attack. To understand this duality, hackers must get hands-on time attacking all kinds of networks. You really need to see both success and failure, both self-inflicted and environmental, to fully understand how to compromise Wi-Fi networks.

This workshop isn't targeted at Faraday-level attendees. We assume that you know what a laptop and Wi-Fi is and continue from there. What you'll be doing in this workshop is:

0. Determining your desired result of the attack
1. Reconnoitering Wi-Fi networks and RF spectrum
2. Identifying and prioritizing network and station targets
3. Determining the best attack type for identified targets
4. Hacking the bejeezus out of the target while avoiding detection
    
You'll do all of these amazing things with your laptop and Kali Linux. Kali has an exceptional set of Wi-Fi hacking tools built right in that you'll become much more familiar with during this session. You'll use a variety of tools to identify networks and connected stations, conduct broadcast denial of service attacks, capture authentication handshakes, and crack session keys.

Pip and Alex will demonstrate some techniques using different hardware like spectrum analyzers and noise generators so you can decide whether those are tools you want to add to your toolbox as well. However, none of those tools are necessary for the workshop, and many hackers never need anything beyond a laptop, Kali, a good wordlist, and practice.

Devices that connect our bodies to a network are especially intriguing. These devices are often fraught with vulnerabilities and security concerns. In this workshop participants will have an opportunity to learn about different medical devices and explore their attack surfaces. There will be a collection of connected medical devices on-premise that we will scan, take-apart, and explore. Some of the topics in the course will include: network scanning for medical devices, firmware analysis, vulnerability hunting, Wireless/RF analysis, and hardware analysis and assessment.

We will cover vulnerabilities on the insecure DICOM protocol. We are going to showcase how to leverage pynetdicom to write python scripts for attacking DICOM and exploit insecurely configured PACS servers leading to the extraction of sensitive PHI (Protected Health Information). DICOM, being a highly complex protocol, can also allow for other attack vectors such as embedding PE malware. Another aspect of the training will cover vulnerabilities found in IoT infrastructure with a focus on IP cameras and video management servers. These often run insecure protocols like zeroconf and have web portals that are easily authentication brute-forceable and poorly configured. We are specifically going to examine the WS-Discovery protocol which provides some interesting attack vectors by putting too much trust on the local network.

From EK to DEK: Analyzing Document Exploit Kits,Thursday,10:00,"Flamingo, Red Rock I",240,workshop,"Josh Reynolds Senior Security Researcher, Crowdstrike","Exploit Kits haven't disappeared, they've simply moved to Microsoft Office. Traditional Exploit Kits (EKs) have the ability to fingerprint and compromise web browser environments, but with the advent of sandboxing and advanced security measures, there has been a shift toward using the Microsoft Office environment as a primary attack surface. Document Exploit Kits (DEKs) leverage DCOM, ActiveX controls, and logic bugs to compromise machines by packing multiple exploits into a single file.

In this workshop you will learn how to analyze exploits, shellcode, and infection chains produced by modern Document Exploit Kits such as ThreadKit and VenomKit.

This workshop is aimed at security professionals who are interested in gaining experience with reverse engineering, malware analysis and exploit development. Previous experience in any of these areas will assist the attendee in completing the workshop successfully in a timely fashion. The skills learned in this workshop are most applicable to those who work or are interested in blue team areas, such as those in security operations centers (SOCs), incident responders, intel analysts, and reverse engineers. Those who work or are interested in red team areas will find the content applicable for re-implementation for use in offensive exercises.

Constructing Kerberos Attacks with Delegation Primitives,Thursday,10:00,"Flamingo, Red Rock VII",240,workshop,"Elad Shamir Managing Security Consultant, The Missing Link Security.,Matt Bush Security Consultant, The Missing Link Security","Kerberos delegation is a dangerously powerful feature that allows services to impersonate users. Due to the complexity of Kerberos delegation attacks, they are often overlooked or left unexplored. However, the introduction of Resource-based Constrained Delegation substantially widens the Kerberos attack surface, making it more important than ever for security professionals to engage with this challenge. This workshop will offer security professionals a deep dive into Kerberos delegation and demonstrate how it can be abused for privilege escalation and lateral movement.

We will open with a crash-course in Microsoft's Kerberos implementation and its delegation features, from the fundamentals of Kerberos authentication, through legacy unconstrained delegation, to classic constrained delegation. We will offer demos and hands-on labs to experiment with abusing these features.

In the second half of the workshop, we will cover resource-based constrained delegation, explain the differences between classic constrained delegation and resource-based constrained delegation, and explore novel attack primitives including:
- Compromising hosts by modifying Active Directory computer objects
- Bypassing restrictions on protocol transition to impersonate arbitrary users
- Compromising a host by abusing the ticket-granting-ticket of a computer account
- Performing local privilege escalation on Windows 10 and Windows Server 2016/2019 hosts by abusing account profile pictures
- Performing remote code execution on SQL Servers through directory listing abuse
- Achieving hostless domain persistence

An Introduction to Deploying Red Team Infrastructure,Thursday,14:30,"Flamingo, Red Rock I",240,workshop,"Troy Defty Hacker,Erik Dul Hacker","The use of remote-access malware has never been more prevalent, and in order to replicate or mitigate this threat, an understanding as to how the infrastructure supporting such an attack operates is crucial. From accounting for outbound network filtering controls, to building resilience with redundant inbound proxies, deploying an implant blindly into a target is more complex than 'msf > exploit'.

This workshop aims to build an understanding around how malware Command and Control (C2) infrastructure is designed, built, and configured, and to provide attendees with experience in deploying malware within a realistic network environment. This will include:

- A run-through of a basic red team campaign
- The properties of a solid malware implant
- Spinning-up Command and Control (C2) infrastructure, including burner inbound proxies, etc.
- Configuring an implant to find and utilise outbound routes from a realistic corporate network, and to call back to our new infrastructure
- Basic delivery of malware via common delivery routes
- Gaining a persistent presence, and identifying routes to the campaign objectives

We will be using Meterpreter and the Metasploit framework as the implant supported by Kali Linux, alongside Apache as a reverse proxy; all of which will be cloud-hosted. We will be using a variety of post-exploitation techniques to help attendees get to grips with some of the potential nuances of remote malware interaction (long RTTs, blind command execution, etc.).

Attacking Layer 2 Network Protocols,Friday,14:30,"Flamingo, Red Rock I",240,workshop,"Erik Dul Hacker,Troy Defty Hacker","Layer 2 can be a lesser-known attack surface; the techniques have been known for a while, have well-documented mitigations, and are often thought of as so old, they _can't possibly still be around, right?_ 

But this under-represented attack surface is also of great value to an attacker. Network segregation on a typical internal network is commonplace, and often heavily relied upon to segregate, isolate, and limit the spread of a compromise. A misconfigured switch or switch port can be the difference between an attacker compromising the desk phones, and core business server infrastructure. And when the misconfiguration can be a single two-word line in a ten-thousand line switch configuration file, it's easy to see how the basic hardening controls can be missed.

This workshop will run through analysing Layer 2 network traffic, identifying protocols and information of interest within network traffic, launching DTP attacks to pivot within a misconfigured network, and man-in-the-middling traffic via this pivot to compromise a target host (including using various tools in conjunction with virtual network interfaces). In terms of tooling, we will be looking to utilise the likes of Wireshark, Yersinia and Bettercap to launch the various network attacks, with standard Kali tooling/normal Linux functionality to exploit and escalate privileges on the target host.

Defending environments and hunting malware with osquery,Friday,14:30,"Flamingo, Red Rock VII",240,workshop,Guillaume Ross Hacker,"In this workshop, you will learn how to defend Linux and Windows environments with osquery, using techniques that could easily be adapted to Mac and containerized environments. Then, we will look at how we can leverage osquery to hunt for malware and attackers, as well as how we could use osquery in a controlled environment to do some basic malware analysis.

We will cover osquery deployment scenarios and configurations as well as ways we can implement it to improve the security of servers and workstations.

Specifically, we will use osquery to monitor specific security configurations, detect lateral movement, detect malware, and even see how we can use it in lab environments to analyze malware.

If you have never used osquery before, this workshop will get you started. If you have used osquery before, this workshop will help you get the most out of it, by allowing you to develop queries and an understanding of the schema and how it can be applied to protect environments and detect attacks.

The topics covered will include:

* Setup, configuration and flags
* Logging results
* Building simple to complex queries
* Monitoring for lateral movement
* Tracking important security configurations on Windows and Linux
* Detecting malware
* Performing basic malware analysis on a VM with osquery","Guillaume Ross Guillaume has worked as a security engineer and consultant, as a manager of blue teams, and way before that, as an enterprise IT person focused on endpoints.

Functional Programming for the Blue Team,Saturday,10:00,"Flamingo, Valley of Fire II",240,workshop,"eigentourist Software Engineer, Data Scientist","This is an introduction to functional programming concepts. It's not an intro to a language or a tool, but to a set of ideas. It's a powerful one for any hacker to learn, but especially for blue teamers who find themselves writing or maintaining increasingly complex code. Practicing it can help defenders write safer code that scales well.
Why speak particularly toward blue team? 

Defenders are often unsung heros today. Blue teamers, like system admins, may find themselves writing code to glue things together, fill in the gaps between existing tools, or make up for lack of tools altogether. If your codebase evolves into a critical system, the work of managing its rising complexity can become a serious challenge. Defense is hard, and studying the esoterics of software architecture can be a rare luxury (or an exercise in frustration, depending on your situation.) This workshop aims to hand you the distilled, demystified truth, sans the cryptic terminology. We will collectively build some code that illustrates the philosophy of the functional paradigm, and has a good chance of being useful in your work.
Why functional programming? 

This is a paradigm from the days of Lisp and the original generation of MIT hackers. After decades of obscurity, it is moving into the mainstream because it answers two serious problems particularly well: rising code complexity, and the need to support parallelism. Any parts of it that you take away from this workshop are likely to improve your quality of life as a software engineer.

For this workshop, we will choose two programming languages to work with: one for comfort, and one for stretching. Python will be the comfort language, because of its widespread use in many fields. Haskell will be the stretch language, and no one is expected to try it if they're not comfortable. What we want is for you to get a sense of how the functional approach looks, not just in a mainstream language like Python, but also in a language built especially with the functional style in mind.","eigentourist eigentourist is a programmer turned data scientist, with 20 years in application development, and three years in the world of big data and machine learning. He began formal education in computer science when the height of software engineering discipline meant avoiding the use of GOTO statements. Over the course of his career, he has created code of beautiful simplicity and elegance, and of horrific complexity and unpredictability. Sometimes, it's hard to tell which was which. Today, he works on predictive models and computing clusters in the health care industry.", Intermediate," Some CS fundamentals are helpful, but anyone who has written code as part of their job should be able to walk away with something of value. We won't be using the arcane vocabulary associated with this field, except in the tiniest of amounts, until we begin to talk theory at the end.

Mind the Gap Between Attacking Windows and Mac: Breaking In and Out of Protected MacOS environments,Saturday,10:00,"Flamingo, Lake Mead I",240,workshop,Richard Gold Hacker,"MacOS has a strong reputation for security and comes with many restrictions such as the usage of an App Store to prevent malicious code being installed. However, we have found that since MacOS is the minority platform for many software packages and security platforms, it rarely gets the same attention from security vendors as Windows. This workshop will teach you to exploit that lack of attention from software like Microsoft Office and security platforms like a leading EDR solution to break in and out of a MacOS estate. The principles also apply to other *nix environments like Linux.

We will walk you through how to use open source tools, both unmodified and customized, can be used to take advantage of the difference in capability, e.g., script detection, between Windows and non-Windows platforms. We will show you how to map out an environment, how to gain code execution in multiple ways, grab credentials, find files, collect screenshots and webcam shots and exfiltrate the loot while remaining undetected.

The key takeaway is that despite the myriad of operating system security features present in MacOS and Linux, and the addition of EDR, protected MacOS or Linux environments can still be compromised by a diligent attacker using open source tooling. This workshop will show you how!

[Unfortunately we cannot provide an EDR system for you to play with, so please bring your own or practice the techniques without that particular opponent.]","Richard Gold Richard Gold is a hands-on information security professional, who has over a decade's worth of experience in understanding and securing computer networks.

Well, even if ICS are more and more interconnected, we can probably say yes for network segmentation, as well as patching. And it is mostly true for critical infrastructures that must comply with multiple laws around the world. But what about the most critical components such as PLCs?

In this workshop, you will learn how to attack PLCs, by attacking ICS protocols: a well-known legacy protocol, Modbus, as well as an open source protocol considered as the future of ICS communications, OPC-UA. And to do so, what could be better than giving you hands-on experience on real devices by hacking our model train?

We will start by defining industrial control systems and its main components, as well as explaining the key risks and vulnerabilities that affect them. We will then focus on their key assets, Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs), and discover how they work, how they communicate, how they can be programmed to learn the methods and tools you can use to p*wn them.

Then we will move on to real-world by attacking real PLCs from two major manufacturers on a dedicated setup featuring robot arms and a model train!
