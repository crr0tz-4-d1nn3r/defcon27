Hacking Kubernetes - Choose Your Own Adventure Style,Friday,14:30,"Skyview 1, 2, 5, 6 -Bally's",120,workshop,"Jay Beale, CTO of InGuardians","Kubernetes continues to gain steam, as developers build microservice-based applications and everyone moves to the software-defined data center. A small minority of our Infosec industry has experience attacking container orchestration systems like Kubernetes.  We aim to address that shortage, culminating in an audience-directed Choose Your Own Adventure, ""Hackers"" movie-themed demo. In this demo-heavy talk, we will show you how to attack Kubernetes clusters and discuss what hardening techniques and freely available tools can break those attacks.  We'll review the components of a Kubernetes cluster, then show how a threat actor can chain configuration vulnerabilities to pivot and escalate privilege, pilfer data and take over clusters and the cloud environments on which they run. To be clear, you'll see multiple attacks against real clusters from start to finish.  You will also gain exposure to a new open source tool attack tool for Kubernetes called Peirates, available on Github. You will leave this talk with exposure to attacks against clusters that organizations have built themselves, as well as clusters provided by the major cloud providers, like AWS, Azure and GCP. You will be able to repeat specific attacks and know what defenses can break those attacks.","Jay Beale (Twitter: @jaybeale) works on Kubernetes and cloud native security, as a professional threat actor, a Kubernetes Contributor and as a member of the Kubernetes Security Audit working group.

Tools? We Don’t Need No Stinkin’ Tools: Hands-on Hacking with Python,Saturday,11:20,"Skyview 1, 2, 5, 6 -Bally's",120,workshop,"Jason Nickola, Directory of Technical Services, Pulsar SecurityWayne Marsh, Senior Software Engineer, Pulsar Security","The hacking world is full of fantastic tools, but the ability to write your own in order to customize and achieve new functionality is the real black magic. This workshop quickly builds from programming and python fundamentals to manual construction of real-world attack tactics and techniques. Prior hacking and programming skills are not required (although they help), but basic technical knowledge and an ahead-of-time review of introductory topics are highly recommended.

Writing Wireshark Plugins for Security Analysis,Saturday,13:40,"Skyview 1, 2, 5, 6 -Bally's",120,workshop,"Nishant Sharma, R&D Manager, Pentester AcademyJeswin Mathai, Security Researcher, Pentester Academy","Network traffic always proves to be a gold mine when mined with proper tools. There are various open source and paid tools to analyze the traffic but most of them either have predefined functionality or scalability issues or one of a dozen other problems. And, in some cases when we are dealing with non-standard protocols, the analysis becomes more difficult. But, what if we can extend our favourite traffic analysis tool Wireshark to accommodate our requirements? As most people know, Wireshark supports custom plugins created in C and Lua which can be used to analyze or dissect the packets. In this workshop, we will learn the basics of Wireshark plugins and move on to create different types of plugins to perform dissection of non-standard protocol, provide macro statistics, detect attacks etc. We will use examples of older and newer protocols (including non-standard ones) to understand the plugin workflow and development.","Nishant Sharma (Twitter: @wifisecguy) is an R&D Manager at Pentester Academy and Attack Defense.

This is the workshop for you. Using a real-worldish dataset, this workshop will teach you how to hunt the “fictional” APT group Taedonggang. We discuss the Diamond model, hypothesis building, LM Kill Chain, and Mitre ATT&CK framework and how these concepts can frame your hunting. Using the freely available version of Splunk and OSINT, we will hunt for APT activity riddling a small startup's network. During the event, you will be presented a hypothesis and conduct your own hunts, whether it is for persistence, exfiltration, c2 or other adversary tactics. Heck, there might be some PowerShell to be found, too. We will regroup and review the specific hunt and discuss findings and what opportunities we have to operationalize these findings as well. At the end, we give you a dataset and tools to take home and try newly learned techniques yourself.","John Stoner (Twitter: @stonerpsu) is a Principal Security Strategist at Splunk where he enjoys writing, problem solving and building stuff.
