A Theme Of Fear: Hacking The Paradigm,Friday,14:00,"Savoy Ballroom, The Flamingo Hotel",60,Blue Team village,@investigatorchi,"The InfoSec industry was born out of fear. Initially it was fear from virus infections and later, external attacks. We capitalized on that fear to build more secure environments. But fear is hard to manage: too much fear breeds paralysis, and too little fear breeds complacency.  This talk will take a look at the history of fear in InfoSec, explore how its impact has shaped the industry, and how it is now getting in the way. Fortunately, we can provide the next generation a new paradigm to affect change. This talk presents some ideas on what the new security paradigm could be, and most importantly - how to enable a security-minded culture without using fear.","@investigatorchi is a security researcher, speaker, and Senior Information Security Analyst at University at Buffalo with over 20 years of highly technical experience. In her current role, Cathy is a data forensics and incident response (DFIR) specialist, performing incident management, intrusion detection, investigative services, and personnel case resolution in a dynamic academic environment. She additionally builds security awareness amongst faculty and staff via a comprehensive department-wide program which educates and informs users about how to prevent and detect social engineering threats, and how to compute and digitally communicate safely. Cathy has presented at numerous prestigious information security conferences including DEF CON and Hacker Halted. In her (minimal) spare time, she enjoys visiting her adopted two-toed sloth Flash at the Buffalo zoo, researching death and the dead, and learning more about hacking things to make the world a more secure place."
Detection At Google: On Corp And Cloud,Friday,15:00,"Savoy Ballroom, The Flamingo Hotel",60,Blue Team village,"@fryx0r , @JSteeleIR ","An overview of detection at Google: An introduction to Google's Blue team and its technologies, and how we use currently available tools to investigate on Google Cloud (GCP). We will cover the structure and setup of our team; give a detailed explanation of the main tools and services we use (with an emphasis on the ones that are open source, so you can use them yourself); and delve deeply into how to do detection on GCP - going beyond finding simple misconfigurations and instead detailing how to use available tools and logs to increase visibility and find badness.","@fryx0r is a Security Engineer on Google's detection and response team. He works out of the Sydney office, having previously worked for the Department of Defence, FireEye and Commonwealth Bank. He enjoys writing Golang and making memes, and in his spare time travels around the world running Magic the Gathering tournaments.@JSteeleIR is a Security Engineer with 6+ years of experience in Detection, Response, Forensics, Reverse Engineering, and Automation. Some of that's been at Google. Some has been in the cloud. Some of it was good. When not sparring in the cyberspaces, he can be found camping, collecting odd input devices (possibly using those to reimplement the less PAGER in Golang) or attempting (and failing) to sleep on a normal schedule."
Blue Team Guide For Fresh Eyes,Friday,16:30,"Savoy Ballroom, The Flamingo Hotel",30,Blue Team village,@sopooped,"The life of a blue-teamer is daunting. There are logs to sift through, tasks to automate, incidents to triage, vulnerabilities to manage, meetings to attend, coffee to drink, etc. Scenarios have moving parts, procedures might not be documented, and solutions can vary. At times, the responsibilities can be compared to an ever growing fire, and all there is a pail of water. How do you put out the flames if you're not a seasoned professional? This talk lays out existing challenges for those trying to break into the fast-moving world of defensive security and ways to tackle them. Included are anecdotes, highlights, and pro-tips.","@sopooped leveraged her development background, Christine builds tools to automate security for cloud environments as a Security & Tools Engineer.

Serverless Log Analysis On AWS,Friday,17:30,"Savoy Ballroom, The Flamingo Hotel",30,Blue Team village,@gkapoglis,"In this talk we will go over traditional log analysis methods for AWS Cloudtrail logs and why we needed to find a better way of performing such investigations. We will then dive into AWS Athena which is essentially a serverless hive on the cloud “too many buzzwords alert” and how we use it to perform log analysis on the cloud under a centralized, efficient and transparent framework. We will go over use cases and examples of investigations, showcase investigations and showcase how Athena helped us perform more efficiently than the traditional methods mentioned before. Additionally, we will mention use cases for other type of log analysis like apache access logs, ELB and ALB logs, etc. Lastly, we will demo AWS Athena and analyze over 50GB of logs in under 1 minute, all done on the cloud serverless without the need to spin up any instances or servers. In the end, we will describe the countless possibilities for future work which include, automation, threat hunting and continuous monitoring of your AWS environment.",@gkapoglis an Incident Responder at Verizon Media where I have the chance to work on complex problems at scale!

Anatomy Of A Megabreach: Equifax Report,Saturday,14:00,"Savoy Ballroom, The Flamingo Hotel",60,Blue Team village,@uncl3dumby,"Following testimony in Congress and a lengthy investigation of the Equifax breach in 2016, U.S. House of Representatives drafted a report. The report is AMAZING! It includes details of Equifax corporate structure, IT infrastructure, and covers timelines and minutiae of the breach itself. It has information that is extremely interesting and useful for security practitioners, but we might not all have the time or interest to wade through 97 pages of deep information. I did that for you! My talk is a comprehensive review of the report that covers everything I considered interesting or important.","@uncl3dumby is enamored with defense and protective thinking. My career has focused on security operations, but I love understanding the way systems operate. I'm passionate about investigating root cause of incidents, or how things came to be the way they are.

When A Plan Comes Together: Building A SOC A-Team,Saturday,16:30,"Savoy Ballroom, The Flamingo Hotel",30,Blue Team village,@markaorlando,"The security industry is facing a severe talent shortage, but the threats are growing in number and sophistication. Finding talent, honing it to meet your specific mission, and retaining it have become immense challenges for modern operations teams. In this talk, we’ll explore these challenges and discuss creative ways to find, train, and equip a security operations “A-Team”.","@markaorlando started his security career in 2001 as a Security Analyst, and since then has been both fighting for blue team resources and trying to automate them out of a job. He has built, assessed, and managed security teams at the Pentagon, the White House, the Department of Energy, global Managed Security Service Providers, and numerous financial sector and Fortune 500 clients. Short on patience and attention, Mark is constantly working on new projects to improve defensive security through automation and other short cut-y things so defenders can be more agile and creative.

Killsuit - How The Equation Group Remained Out Of Sight For Years,Saturday,17:30,"Savoy Ballroom, The Flamingo Hotel",30,Blue Team village,"@connormorley, @laciefan","When the shadow brokers released a large number of Equation Group tools in 2017, many researchers jumped on the analysis of EternalBlue, FuzzBunch etc. The exploits of the leak have now been thoroughly analysed and mostly patched, but the works of its persistence tool (Danderspritz) is still widely unknown. In our talk, we are going to break down the Killsuit modules of Danderspritz. Killsuit (KiSu) is a modular post-exploitation persistence and capability mechanism employed in various hacker frameworks including Danderspritz (DdSz).","@connormorley is a Threat Hunter at Countercept, a 24/7 manager Threat hunting service by MWR Infosecurity.

Evaded MicrosoftATA? **But** You Are Completely Exposed By Event Log,Sunday,09:00,"Savoy Ballroom, The Flamingo Hotel",60,Blue Team village,@9ian1i,"Due to internal environment of Windows domains is always too tolerant, and enterprises are more concerned about border defenses than internal security, the penetration behavior based on Windows Active Directory has become more and more popular and aggressive. The emergence of MicrosoftATA allows BlueTeam to perceive and discover most domain penetration activities, however, there are many bypassing techniques for MicrosoftATA recently, and the detection dimension of MicrosoftATA is not comprehensive enough, especially the persistence part. It's a compelling problem whether the Red Team can ensure their behaviors not to be detected after bypassing the detection of MicrosoftATA. In my recent research, the security event log of domain controller details the activity of entities in the domain. Most AD Attacks leave traces in the logs. These logs can be collected and analyzed in real time, helping you quickly detect attacks before an attacker compromises the domain controller. I will detail how to find exceptional behavior from a large number of domain controller security event logs and use a variety of analysis approaches to determine attacks, while taking into account false alarm rate. It's worth mentioning that we don't collect security event log of all computers, only domain controllers. As a result, these ideas are applicable in a large-scale intranet environment, helping Blue Team build its own Advanced Threat Analytics.","@9ian1i is a security researcher, core member of 0keeTeam, Information Security Department of Qihoo 360 Technology Company. He specializes in the construction of Blue Team and security architecture, especially the auto-detection of security vulnerabilities."
Who Dis? Who Dis? The Right Way To Authenticate,Sunday,10:00,"Savoy Ballroom, The Flamingo Hotel",60,Blue Team village,"@Lak5hmi5udheer, @dhivus","In today's ecosystem, verification of identity is no longer applicable just to the user; extending to microservices, cloud providers, IoT devices and many other emerging systems as well. 81% of discovered breaches are due to broken authentication, indicate it as a prevalent issue. Developers are generally aware of different authentication methods used for secure interaction between these entities, but most often lose context on best practices. In this context, we talk about popular authentication schemes like SAML, OAuth, token, magic links, adopted by developers today and emerging ones like WebAuthN. We will present incorrectly coded authentication patterns observed in disclosed reports related to these schemes. Finally, we will conclude with actionable solutions to correct these flaws realized in the form of practical guidelines. These would be security design patterns that developers or designers could refer to in their daily tasks.","@Lak5hmi5udheer is a Security Researcher at Adobe.
