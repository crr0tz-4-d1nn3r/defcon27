Exploiting Windows Exploit Mitigation for ROP Exploits,Thursday,10:00,"DC101, Paris Theatre",45, Demo,Omer Yair Endpoint Team Lead at Symantec,"“A concept is a brick. It can be used to build a courthouse of reason. Or it can be thrown through the window.”
― Gilles Deleuze

Ever since Smashing the Stack For Fun And Profit was published by Aleph One almost a quarter century ago the security world has completely changed the way it defends exploitation. Canary stack, DEP, ASLR, CFI and various other mitigation techniques were developed to address various exploit techniques. Yet, ROP remains a prominent practice employed by many exploits even today.

ROP is the most common exploitation method for attackers to mutate memory bugs on target process into malicious executable code. “Next Gen” endpoint security products try to address ROP and other exploitation methods. Windows embraces many mitigation techniques as well. However, these mitigation features such as CFG can in fact be leveraged and increase ROP’s attack surface and allow it to even bypass exploit protections!

If you are intrigued by ROP, want to learn about methods in Windows that protect against ROP and how to bypass them - this talk is for you! On top of that a novel method of bypassing ROP mitigation of most products will also be revealed.","Omer Yair Omer is End-Point team lead at Symantec (formerly Javelin Networks).

Breaking Google Home: Exploit It with SQLite(Magellan),Thursday,11:00,"DC101, Paris Theatre",45," Demo, Exploit",Wenxiang Qian Senior security researcher at Tencent Blade Team,"Over the past years, our team has used several new approaches to identify multiple critical vulnerabilities in SQLite and Curl, two of the most widely used basic software libraries. These two sets of vulnerabilities, which we named ""Magellan"" and ""Dias"" respectively, affect many devices and software. We exploited these vulnerabilities to break into some of the most popular Internet of things devices, such as Google Home with Chrome. We also exploited them on one of the most widely used Web server (Apache+PHP) and one of the most commonly used developer tool (Git).

In this presentation, we will share how we try to crack the Google Home from both hardware and software aspects, get and analyze the newest firmware, solve the problem, and introduce new methods to discover vulnerabilities in SQLite and Curl through Fuzz and manual auditing. Through these methods, we found ""Magellan"", a set of three heap buffer overflow and heap data disclosure vulnerabilities in SQLite ( CVE-2018-20346, CVE-2018-20505 CVE-2018-20506 ) We also found ""Dias"", two remote memory leak and stack buffer overflow vulnerabilities in Curl ( CVE-2018-16890 and CVE-2019-3822 ). Considering the fact that these vulnerabilities affect many systems and software, we have issued a vulnerability alert to notify the vulnerable vendor to fix it.

We will disclose the details of ""Magellan"" and ""Dias"" for the first time and highlight some of our new vulnerability exploitation techniques. In the first part, we will introduce the results of our analysis on hardware, how to get the newest firmware from simulating an update request, and attack surface of Google Home. We will show how to use Magellan to complete the remote exploit of Google Home, we will also give a brefing talk about how to use Dias to complete the remote attack on Apache+PHP and Git. Finally, we will summarize our research and provide some security development advice to the basic software library developers.","Wenxiang Qian Wenxiang Qian is a senior security researcher at the Tencent Blade Team.

Are Quantum Computers Really A Threat To Cryptography? A Practical Overview Of Current State-Of-The-Art Techniques With Some Interesting Surprises,Thursday,12:00,"DC101, Paris Theatre",45, Demo,"Andreas Baumhof Vice President Quantum Technologies, QuintessenceLabs Inc.","Shor's Algorithm for factoring integer numbers is the big threat to cryptography (RSA/ECC) as it reduces the complexity from exponential to polynomial, which means a Quantum Computer can reduce the time to crack RSA-2048 to a mere 10 seconds. However current noisy NISQ type quantum computers are very limited to something like 16 bit RSA keys. And the quality of the current qubits is so bad that error-correction comes at a massive cost of at least 100 times the amount of qubits.

While the world is pre-occupied whether we have universal quantum computers big enough for Shor's algorithm, Quantum Annealing is stealing the show with having factored a 20-bit number just in January this year using 97 qubits. And these qubits are actually good enough to factor bigger numbers. If we assume a linear scalability, we'd ""only"" need around 10,000 qubits to factor a 2048bit RSA key. D-Wave announced a quantum computer with 5,640 qubits, so that puts it within reach soon. 

So, could Quantum Annealing be more of a threat to cryptography than Shor's algorithm on universal quantum computers? How do these algorithms work? How do they achieve a polynomial complexity to what traditional computers need exponential time? What impact will this have on the competition from NIST for the design of post-quantum-cryptography algorithms?","Andreas Baumhof Andreas Baumhof is Vice President Quantum Technologies at Quintessence Labs.

"Intro to Embedded Hacking—How you too can find a decade old bug in widely deployed devices.  [REDACTED] Deskphones, a case study.",Thursday,13:00,"DC101, Paris Theatre",45," Demo, Exploit",Philippe Laulheret Senior Security Researcher @ McAfee Advanced Threat Research,"From small business to large enterprise, VOIP phones can be found on nearly every desk. But how secure are they? What if your phone was spying on every conversation you have? 
This talk is an introduction to hardware hacking and as a case study I’ll use the [REDACTED] Deskphone, a device frequently deployed in corporate environments. I’ll use it to introduce the tools and methodology needed to answer these questions.  
 
During this talk, attendees will get a close up look at the operations of a hardware hacker, including ARM disassembly, firmware extraction using binwalk, micro-soldering to patch an EEPROM and get a root shell over UART, and ultimately uncover an already known decade-old bug that somehow remained unnoticed in the device’s firmware.  
 
Beyond the case study I will also address alternative tactics; some did not work, others may have but were not the lowest-hanging fruit. When it comes to hardware hacking, the process is as important as the result; knowing that there are multiple ways to reach the end goal helps researchers remain confident when hurdles arise. After the talk, attendees will have an increased distrust towards always-on devices; however, they will have the background knowledge to investigate the products and systems they encounter daily.","Philippe Laulheret Philippe Laulheret is a Senior Security Researcher on the McAfee Advanced Threat Research team.

Web2Own: Attacking Desktop Apps From Web Security's Perspective,Thursday,14:00,"DC101, Paris Theatre",45,,Junyu Zhou Security Researcher in Tencent Security Xuanwu Lab,"People are always talking about binary vulnerabilities when attacking desktop applications. Memory corruptions are always costly to find. Meanwhile, mitigations introduced by operating systems make them harder to be exploited. More and more applications are using hybrid technologies, so we can try web security tricks to pwn them reliably with less effort.

Our presentation will summarize attack surfaces and methods to find security issues in desktop applications. In particular, we will explicate some real-world cases, such as chaining multiple vulnerabilities (information leaking, CSP bypass, opened debugging port) to achieve RCE in a specialized IDE, sensitive file leaking in famous editors, privileged APIs abusing in many IM applications and so on. During our research, we find some issues actually reside in popular libraries. These flaws may affect more applications than we will demonstrate in this talk.

Web security knowledge is usually unfamiliar to desktop application developers. Attacking desktop apps using web security tricks is a non-competitive ""blue ocean"". Our presentation will focus on many design misconceptions and implementation mistakes in desktop applications. By sharing these representative lessons, we hope to help desktop application developers improve the security of their products.","Junyu Zhou Junyu Zhou, Security Researcher in Tencent Security Xuanwu Lab, CTF player from 0ops/A*0*E, is focusing on vulnerability research and web application security.

Behind the Scenes: The Industry of Social Media Manipulation Driven by Malware,Friday,10:00,Track 3,45,,Olivier Bilodeau Cybersecurity Research Lead at GoSecure,"This talk is the grand finale of a four-year long investigation that started with analyzing an IoT botnet, to discovering the structured industry that exists behind social media manipulation (SMM). SMM is the deliberate act of paying for popularity with followers or activity on social media.

Adopting a bottom-up approach, the thorough methodology undertook to study the botnet will be presented: from building honeypots, infecting them with malware and conducting a man-in-the-middle-attack on the honeypots’ traffic to access the decrypted HTTPS content between the C&Cs and social networks. Then, the various investigative paths taken to analyze this large data set, leading to the discovery of industry actors involved in the supply chain of social media manipulation, will be presented. These investigative paths include traffic analysis, various OSINT approaches to reveal and understand actors, reverse-engineering the software that automates the use and creation of fake accounts, forum investigations, and qualitative profiling. All actors involved in the industry will be mapped, from malware authors, to reseller panels, and customers of fake popularity.

The potential profitability of the industry will then be discussed, as well as the revenue division in the chain, demonstrating that the ones making the highest revenue per fake follower sold are not the malware authors, but rather those at the end of the chain.","Olivier Bilodeau Olivier Bilodeau is leading the Cybersecurity Research team at GoSecure.

Duplicating Restricted Mechanical Keys,Friday,10:00,Track 4,45, Exploit,"Bill Graydon President and Principal, Physical Security Analytics","Secure facilities in North America use lock systems like Medeco, Abloy, Assa and Mul-T-Lock partly to resist lock picking, but also to prevent the duplication and creation of unauthorised keys.  Places such as the White House and the Canadian Parliament buildings go so far as to use a key profile exclusive to that facility to ensure that no-one is able to obtain key blanks on which to make a copy.  However, there are tens of thousands of unrestricted key blank profiles in existence - many match very closely to these restricted key blanks, and can be used instead of the real blanks to cut keys on. Moreover, keys are just pieces of metal - we will present numerous practical techniques to create restricted keys without authorisation - including new attacks on Medeco, Mul-T-Lock and Abloy key control systems.  We will touch on all aspects of key control, including patents and interactive elements, and discuss how to defeat them and how facility managers can fight back against these attacks.","Bill Graydon Bill Graydon is a principal at GGR Security Consultants, and is active in research in electronic surveillance and alarm systems, human psychology in a secure environment and locking systems analysis.

Then things got weird, with China's nationwide active probing infrastructure to enumerate bridges, with Amazon rolling over to Russia's threats when Telegram used ""domain fronting"" to get around blocking, with Turkey blocking Tor traffic by DPI in more subtle ways, with Venezuela and Ethiopia and Iran trying new tricks, and more.

In-Kernel Bytecode Runtime",Friday,11:00,Track 4,45," Demo, Exploit","Jeff Dileo Research Director, NCC Group","eBPF (or ""extended"" Berkeley Packet Filter) is a bytecode instruction set and virtual machine used as a safe computing environment within the Linux kernel to perform arbitrary programmatic actions. It is a redesign of Linux's original in-kernel BPF bytecode VM used to power features like tcpdump filters. eBPF has an entirely different set of capabilities and instructions, with its primary goal being to serve as a JIT-able virtual machine instruction set that can be targeted by compilers of a memory-safe ""restricted C"" language. In the Linux kernel, it is actively being applied to anything and everything to provide performant programmatic capabilities to userland that extend traditionally kernel-based functionality.

In this exploit development focused talk, we will first introduce eBPF and discuss several nefarious techniques enabled by the technology. As we do so, we will cover the respective sets of APIs, file descriptor types, and other eBPF machinery that enable such techniques, building up from various forms of hidden IPC channels to full-fledged rootkits. Within this talk, we will walk through the implementations of the techniques we discuss so that attendees will walk away with the knowledge of how to implement their own variants. Along the way we will discuss novel container breakout techniques and interesting ""dual-purpose"" eBPF features that enable the development of mutative syscall hooks that work for processes that work for processes already attached by a debugger. Finally, we will provide insight on how defenders should begin to attempt to detect and recover from such abuses, when possible at all.

Election security, blockchain, ""going dark,"" the vulnerabilities equities debate, IoT safety , data privacy, algorithmic security and fairness, critical infrastructure: these are all important public policy issues with a strong Internet security component. But while an understanding of the technology involved is fundamental to crafting good policy, there is little involvement of technologists in policy discussions. This is not sustainable. We need public-interest technologists: people from our fields helping craft policy, and working to provide security to agencies and groups working in the broader public interest. We need these people in government, at NGOs, teaching at universities, as part of the press, and inside private companies. This is increasingly critical to both public safety and overall social welfare. This talk both describes the current state of public-interest technology, and offers a way forward for us individually and collectively for our field. The defining policy question of the Internet age is this: How much of our lives should be governed by technology, and under what terms? We need to be involved in that debate.SSL VPNs protect corporate assets from Internet exposure, but what if SSL VPNs themselves are vulnerable? They’re exposed to the Internet, trusted to reliably guard the only way to intranet. However, we found pre-auth RCEs on multiple leading SSL VPNs, used by nearly half of the Fortune 500 companies and many government organizations. To make things worse, a “magic” backdoor was found to allow changing any user’s password with no credentials required! To show how bad things can go, we will demonstrate gaining root shell from the only exposed HTTPS port, covertly weaponizing the server against their owner, and abusing a hidden feature to take over all VPN clients!

In such complicated closed-source systems, gaining root shell from outside the box certainly ain’t easy. It takes advanced web and binary exploitation techniques to struggle for a way to root shell, which involves abusing defects in web architectures, hard-core Apache jemalloc exploitation and more. We will cover every detail of all the dirty tricks, crazy bug chains, and the built-in backdoor. After gaining root shell into the box, we then elaborate on post exploitation and how we hack back the clients. In addition, we will share the attack vectors against SSL VPNs to kick start researches on similar targets. On the other hand, from our previous experience, we derive general hardening actions that mitigate not only all the above attacks, but any other potential 0days.

In summary, we disclose practical attacks capable of compromising millions of targets, including tech giants and many industry leaders.

Vulnerabilities Across the Web",Friday,12:00,Track 4,45," Demo, Exploit","Joshua Maddux Security Researcher / Software Engineer, PKC Security","The 2016 WWDC saw the dawn of Apple Pay Web, an API that lets websites embed an Apple Pay button within their web-facing stores.  Supporting it required a complex request flow, complete with client certificates and a custom session server. This proved detrimental, since Apple failed to caution against important side effects of taking in untrusted URLs.  As a result, many new SSRF vulnerabilities entered the world. Worse yet, while they were exploitable and discoverable in similar ways, they were spread across distinct codebases in several programming languages, so could not be patched in any generic way.

Apple is not alone - in the process of gluing the web together, Twilio, Salesforce, and others have all created similarly broad attack surfaces.  When companies fail to take an honest, empathetic look at how clients will use a product, they shove along hidden security burdens. Those who integrate with an API have less context than those who create it, so are in a worse position to recognize these risks.

Engineers have been talking about defensive programming for decades, but top companies still have trouble practicing it.

When the pointer is about to be used, the PAC is extracted and verified whether it is consistent with the original pointer value. In this way, PAuth is able to ensure that the pointers are not tampered. iOS deployed PAuth in user-space system services, protecting pointers that may affect the control flow and preventing code-reuse attacks like ROP and JOP.

However, in our study, we found that a fatal flaw in the implementation of iOS PAuth makes user-space system services till vulnerable to code-reuse attacks. The flaw is: iOS uses the same signing key in different user-space processes. This flaw allows a signed pointer from a malicious process can be correctly verified in a system service, thus making it possible to launch JOP. In this talk, we will explain how we found the flaw and why it is inevitable. In advance, we will demonstrate how to leverage this flaw and launch JOP attacks in a PAuth-protected system service. Also, we will propose a new tool, PAC-gadget, to automatically find JOP gadgets in PAuth-protected binaries.","Xiaolong Bai Xiaolong Bai (twitter@bxl1989, github@bxl1989) is a security engineer in Alibaba Orion Security Lab.

HVACking: Understand the Difference Between Security and Reality!,Friday,13:00,Track 2,45, Demo,"Douglas McKee Senior Security Researcher, McAfee Advanced Threat Research","Like most modern devices, building controllers have increasingly become network connected, exposing them to a wider range of threats. If malicious actors could manipulate access control systems, boiler rooms, or temperature control for critical industrial systems, the potential for catastrophic damage is extreme.

McAfee's ATR team has discovered a 0-day vulnerability in a major building controller.  This controller is a fully programmable native BACnet™ device designed to manage a wide range of building systems.  By modifying BACnet broadcast traffic, a buffer overflow can be leveraged into a write-what-where (WWW) condition. This WWW leads to execution control, providing the attacker with a root shell and complete control over the device remotely.  Because this attack vector is through BACnet broadcast traffic, there is no authentication mechanism for the target device, allowing anyone on the same network to communicate with it directly and exploit the vulnerability without authentication. Currently, there are over 500 of these devices connected to the internet running in BACnet/IP Broadcast Management Device (BBMD) mode.  Utilizing this mode, broadcast traffic can travel over the internet, increasing the potentially devastating impact of this vulnerability.

This presentation will include a deep technical analysis of the vulnerability discovery process and demos illustrating an attack in a critical scenario.  Finally, we will discuss the steps taken by the vendor to patch this vulnerability and demonstrate its effectiveness.","Douglas McKee Douglas McKee is a senior security researcher for the McAfee Advanced Threat Research team, focused on finding new vulnerabilities in both software and hardware.

MOSE: Using Configuration Management for Evil,Friday,15:00,Track 1,45," Demo, Tool","Jayson Grace Penetration Tester, Splunk","Configuration Management (CM) tools are used to provision systems in a uniform manner. CM servers are prime targets for exploitation because they are connected with key machines. The tools themselves are powerful from a security standpoint: they allow an attacker to run commands on any and every connected system. Unfortunately, many security professionals do not have CM experience, which prevents them from using these tools effectively. MOSE empowers the user to weaponize an organization’s CM tools without having to worry about implementation-specific details.

MOSE first creates a binary based on user input. Once transferred to the CM server and run, this binary dynamically generates code that carries out the desired malicious behavior on specified systems. This behavior can include running arbitrary system commands, creating or deleting files, and introducing backdoors. MOSE puts the generated code in the proper place so that all targeted systems will run it on their next check-in with the server, removing the need for the user to integrate it manually.

CM tools are a powerful resource, but they have a barrier to entry. MOSE aims to remove this barrier and make post exploitation more approachable by providing a tool to translate the attacker's desired task into commands executable by the CM infrastructure.","Jayson Grace Jayson Grace is a Penetration Tester on the Product Security Team at Splunk.

Many mitigations can detect ROP due to heuristics, but these fail to detect Jump-oriented Programming (JOP). The JOP ROCKET is a reverse engineering framework dedicated to facilitating JOP exploits. It allows hackers to discover JOP gadgets. This includes dispatcher gadget's, which helps to subvert and direct the control flow, and functional gadgets, our primitives. This tool provides numerous options to give hackers flexibility on how to find gadgets, to narrow and expand possibilities. Additionally, the tool uses opcode-splitting to discover many unintended gadgets. All gadgets are classified based on operation as well as registers used and affected. Thus, hackers could easily obtain the desired functional gadgets, such as MOV EBX, [VALUE], using simple language commands. Because of JOP's much more complex set up, the tool provides this classification, so time isn’t wasted hunting through results.

JOP is rarely done in the wild. Part of that complexity is in set up, but another part is the lack of dedicated tools. Having to find JOP gadgets manually could be time-consuming and require expertise. JOP ROCKET simplifies that, allowing the JOP gadgets to be found quickly and easily.

Weaponizing Hypervisors to Fight and Beat Car and Medical Devices Attacks,Saturday,10:00,Track 1,45," Demo, Tool","Ali Islam CEO, Numen Inc.","Historically, hypervisors have existed in the cloud for efficient utilization of resources, space, and money. 

The isolation feature is one of the reasons hypervisors are heavily moving to other ecosystems, like Automobiles, so that for example, if an Infotainment crashes, it does not affect other sensitive ECUs like ADAS. Blackberry QNX and AGL announced the use of hypervisors in their deployments on Cars.

The trending is real, but there is a big challenge! Most of the systems in Cars and Medical devices run on ARM, plus, protection at the hypervisor level is still limited. So, is it possible to have a framework that runs at the hypervisor level, able to monitor at the OS level and most important, capable to identify and kill threats coming into the monitored devices?

During this talk we will walk you through the steps needed to setup a framework running on Xilinx ZCU102 board able to monitor ARM-based devices and to kill malicious threats identified.

However, security controls for network devices such as enterprise printers are often ignored and thus present a greater potential for exploitation and compromise by threat actors seeking to gain a persistent foothold on target organisations.

In order to assess the current state of mainstream enterprise printer product security and to challenge common assumptions made about the security of these devices, which sit on key parts of enterprise networks and process sensitive data, we set out on a vulnerability and exploitation research project of six known vendors. We were able to find remote vulnerabilities in all printers tested through various attack vectors, revealing a large number of 0-day vulnerabilities in the process.

In this talk we walk through the entire research engagement, from initial phases such as threat modelling to understand printer attack surfaces to the development of attack methodologies and fuzzing tools used to target printer-specific protocols and functions. Besides of remarking important vulnerabilities found and their respective CVE’s, proof of concept exploits showing how it is possible to gain full control of printers and all of the data they manage will be presented. This will show how to use enterprise printers as a method of persistence on a network, perhaps to exfiltrate sensitive data or support C2 persistence on Red Team engagements.

We also address a number of challenges that researchers can face when performing vulnerability research on devices such as printers and how we used different techniques to overcome these challenges, working with limited to no debugging and triage capabilities.

Applicable only at the local computer level, a user generally has different rights (through access tokens) on different machines in a domain. Another part of the access control model is security descriptors (ACLs) that protects a securable object. At the domain level, ACL abuse is well known and adversaries have used it for persistence. For user rights, the abuse is mostly with the help of groups (memberships, SID History etc.) or misconfigured delegated rights. 

A lesser-known area of abuse and offensive research is a combination of minimal Rights and ACE (hence the term RACE). Often overlooked in audits and assessments, using minimal rights along with favourable ACEs provides a very interesting technique of persistence and on-demand privilege escalation on a Windows machine with much desired stealth.

GSM: We Can Hear Everyone Now!,Saturday,13:00,Track 2,45," Demo, Exploit","Campbell Murray Global Head Cybersecurity Delivery, BlackBerry","The presentation demonstrates that the security of the A5/1 and A5/3 ciphers used to protect cellular calls are vulnerable to compromise leading to full decryption of GSM communications, using freely available open source solutions along with our tools we developed for this task.

The flaw being exploited lies in the heart of the design of GSM. In all implementations the standard requires GSM messages to first be error control encoded using a convolutional code and then encrypted. In the vast majority of implementations used today, encryption is performed using the A5/1 or A5/3 cipher. The convolutional code adds redundancy to the transmitted message, which can act like a fingerprint to identify the key used to encrypt the GSM message.

To exploit the vulnerability an attacker simply needs to capture a transmission and identify the GSM channel used. The standard defines the convolutional code and therefore how the redundancy may be interpreted to recover the encryption key.

This presentation considers passively capturing GSM traffic using A5/3 encryption and demonstrates a novel solution to cracking the key used without interacting with the mobile or network.","Campbell Murray Campbell Murray is the global head of BlackBerry Cybersecurity Delivery and joined the organization through the acquisition of Encription Ltd, of which he was a founder and director.

Last year, hundreds of security papers and talks on fuzzing have been published and dozens of them were focused on adapting or improving American Fuzzy Lop in some way. Attracting with its simplicity and efficiency, AFL is the number one choice for the vast majority of security researchers. This high popularity means that hunting for bugs with AFL or a similar tool is becoming less and less fruitful since many projects are already covered by other researchers. It is especially hard when we talk about a project participating in Google OSS-Fuzz program which utilizes AFL to generate a half-trillion test cases per day.

In practice, this means that we can not blindly rely on AFL anymore and should search for better fuzzing techniques. In order to overcome this challenge, we need to understand how AFL and similar fuzzers work and be able to use their weaknesses to find new 0days.

Get off the Kernel if you can’t Drive,Saturday,15:00,Track 1,45," Demo. Tool, Exploit",Jesse Michael ,"For software to communicate with hardware, it needs to talk to a kernel-mode driver that serves as a middle-man between the two, helping to make sure everything operates as it should. In Windows that is done using the Kernel-Mode Driver Framework (KMDF).

These drivers are used to control everything in your computer, from small things like CPU fan speed, color of your motherboard LED lights, up to flashing a new BIOS.

However, as the code in these drivers runs with the same privileges as the rest of the kernel, malicious drivers can be used to compromise the security of the platform. To that end, Microsoft relies on WHQL, code signing, and EV Signing to prevent drivers which have not been approved by Microsoft from being loaded into the kernel.

Unfortunately, security vulnerabilities in signed drivers can be used to as a proxy to read and write hardware resources such as kernel memory, internal CPU configuration registers, PCI devices, and more. These helpful driver capabilities can even be misused to bypass and disable Windows protection mechanisms.

Let us teach you how these drivers work, show you the unbelievable risk they pose, and enjoy our walk of shame as we parade all the silly and irresponsible things we discovered in our research.","Jesse Michael Jesse Michael is an experienced security researcher focused on vulnerability detection and mitigation who has worked at all layers of modern computing environments from exploiting worldwide corporate network infrastructure down to hunting vulnerabilities inside processors at the hardware design level.

Pwning Your Azure Environement,Sunday,12:00,Track 1,45," Demo, Tool, Exploit",Dirk-jan Mollema Security Expert - Fox-IT,"After having compromised on-premise for many years, there is now also the cloud! Now your configuration mistakes can be accessed by anyone on the internet, without that fancy next-gen firewall saving you. With this talk I’ll share my current research on Azure privileges, vulnerabilities and what attackers can do once they gain access to your cloud, or how they can abuse your on-premise cloud components. We start with becoming Domain Admin by compromising Azure AD Sync, sync vulnerabilities that allow for Azure admin account takeover and insecure Single Sign On configurations. Up next is cloud roles and privileges, backdooring Azure AD with service accounts, escalating privileges as limited admin and getting past MFA without touching someone's phone. Then we finish with cloud integrations, also known as ""how a developer can destroy your whole infrastructure with a single commit"": Exploring Azure DevOps, backdooring build pipelines, dumping credentials and compromising Azure Resource Manager through connected services. Besides all the fun we'll also look into how this translates into the questions you should ask yourself before moving things to the cloud and how this differs from on-premise.","Dirk-jan Mollema Dirk-jan is one of the core researchers of Active Directory and Azure AD at Fox-IT.

Malproxying: Leave Your Malware at Home,Sunday,12:00,Track 2,45," Demo, Tool","Hila Cohen Security Researcher, XM Cyber","During a classic cyber attack, one of the major offensive goals is to execute code remotely on valuable machines. The purpose of that code varies on the spectrum from information extraction to physical damage. As defenders, our goal is to detect and eliminate any malicious code activity, while hackers continuously find ways to bypass the most advanced detection mechanisms. It’s an endless cat-and-mouse game where new mitigations and features are continuously added to the endpoint protection solutions and even the OS itself in order to protect the users against newly discovered attack techniques.   In this talk, we present a new approach for malicious code to bypass most of endpoint protection measures. Our approach covertly proxies the malicious code operations over the network, never deploying the actual malicious code on the victim side. We are going to execute code on an endpoint, without really storing the code on disk or loading it to memory. This technique potentially allows attackers to run malicious code on remote victims, in such a way that the code is undetected by the victim’s security solutions.  We denote this technique as “malproxying”.","Hila Cohen Hila Cohen is a passionate Security Researcher at XM Cyber, where she investigates new attack techniques and develops detection and mitigation capabilities.

HTTP Desync Attacks: Smashing into the Cell Next Door,Sunday,12:00,Track 3,45," Demo, Tool","albinowax Head of Research, PortSwigger","HTTP requests are traditionally viewed as isolated, standalone entities. In this session, I'll introduce techniques for remote, unauthenticated attackers to smash through this isolation and splice their requests into others, through which I was able to play puppeteer with the web infrastructure of numerous commercial and military systems, rain exploits on their visitors, and harvest over $50k in bug bounties.

Using these targets as case studies, I’ll show you how to delicately amend victim's requests to route them into malicious territory, invoke harmful responses, and lure credentials into your open arms. I’ll also demonstrate using backend reassembly on your own requests to exploit every modicum of trust placed on the frontend, gain maximum privilege access to internal APIs, poison web caches, and compromise my favourite login page.

Although documented over a decade ago, a fearsome reputation for difficulty and collateral damage has left this attack optimistically ignored for years while the web's susceptibility grew. By applying fresh ideas and new techniques, I’ll unveil a vast expanse of vulnerable systems ranging from huge content delivery networks to bespoke backends, and ensure you leave equipped to devise your own desync techniques and tailor attacks to your target of choice.","albinowax James Kettle is Head of Research at PortSwigger Web Security, where he designs and refines vulnerability detection techniques for Burp Suite's scanner.

"Help Me, Vulnerabilities. You're My Only Hope",Sunday,12:00,Track 4,45," Tool, Exploit","Jacob Baines Research Engineer, Tenable","MikroTik routers keep getting owned. They’ve been exploited by advanced threats like VPNFilter, Slingshot APT, and Trickbot. They’ve been compromised by coin miners, botnets, and who knows what else. With each new campaign the security industry publishes new indicators of compromise and everyone moves on.

However, MikroTik administrators operate in a sandbox. They have very limited access to the router’s underlying file system and almost no ability to directly interact with the Linux operating system. Due to these limitations, file hashes cannot answer the fundamental question that is asked again and again on the MikroTik forums, “Have I been compromised?”

It’s time the users had their question answered. In this talk, I’ll present three vulnerabilities that can help MikroTik administrators break out of the sandbox. I’ll show how to use these vulnerabilities to help determine if the router has been compromised.",Jacob Baines Jacob is the founding member of Tenable's Zero Day Research group.

Sound Effects: Exploring Acoustic Cyber-weapons,Sunday,13:00,Track 2,45, Tool,"Matt Wixey Cyber Security Research Lead, PwC UK","While recent research has explored the capability of attacks to cause harm by targeting devices – e.g., SCADA systems, vehicles, medical implant devices - little consideration has been given to the concept of attacks affecting psychological and physiological health by targeting humans themselves.

In a first-of-its-kind study, we assessed the capability of several consumer devices to produce sound at high and low frequencies which may be imperceptible to many people, as a result of remote and local attacks, and compared the resulting sound levels to maximum recommended levels. In doing so, we tested their viability as localised acoustic weapons which could cause temporary/permanent hearing damage and/or adverse psychological effects. We examined a number of countermeasures, including a tool to detect specified frequencies above specified thresholds. 

In this talk, I will cover the background of malware which has, intentionally or not, caused physical or psychological harm. I will explore previous research on the harmful effects of sound, focusing particularly on high and low frequencies, and some of the guidance which has been proposed to limit exposure to such sound. I will examine the use of imperceptible sound as applied to security research (covert channels, ultrasonic tracking beacons, etc), and will present our experiments and findings, including threat models, methodology, the attacks we developed, and the implications of our results.

Want Strong Isolation? Just Reset Your Processor,Sunday,13:00,Track 4,45," Demo, Tool",Anish Athalye PhD student at MIT,"Today's systems sandbox code through traditional techniques: memory protection and user-kernel mode. Even high-security devices like hardware cryptocurrency wallets use such an architecture. Unfortunately, this arrangement has a history of security bugs due to misconfigured protection hardware, bugs in kernel code, hardware bugs, and side channels.

This talk proposes a new approach to isolation for devices like crypto wallets: separate the user and kernel onto two CPUs and multiplex processes by completely resetting the user processor between tasks so that there is no leakage.

Processor reset is more complicated than might be expected. Simply asserting the reset line isn't enough to clear all CPU-internal state, but it turns out that software can be used to clear this state. However, reasoning about the correctness of such code is challenging. This talk presents a tool that can be used to develop and formally verify the correctness of reset code for a given CPU implementation.

This talk also walks through a design of a wallet based on this reset-based isolation technique, discusses known security vulnerabilities in current designs such as the Ledger and Trezor wallets (including bugs in MPU misconfiguration, system calls, and drivers), and explores how a reset-based design could prevent such vulnerabilities.","Anish Athalye Anish is a PhD student at MIT working on systems, security, and formal verification.

"""First-try"" DNS Cache Poisoning with IPv4 and IPv6 Fragmentation",,,,45," Demo, Exploit","Travis (Travco) Palmer Security Research Engineer, Cisco","DNS fragmentation attacks are a more recent series of attacks that take advantage of the consistent composition of fragmented DNS responses by sending a crafted (malicious) second fragment to be reassembled with a legitimate first fragment at the IP layer. Even if DNSSEC is fully implemented, an attacker can still poison unsigned ""glue"" records.

These types of attacks are difficult, and have really only been considered remotely feasible over IPv4. Most nameservers use ""per-destination"" IP-layer ID (IPID) counters, and the IPID in the IPv6 Fragment Extension Header cannot be easily guessed blindly, as the number of bits in the field has been comparatively doubled to 32 bits (making blind-guessing even in ideal conditions take an average 34 million iterations).

Unfortunately, as part of optimizations made to Linux. The IPID counter is no longer truly ""per-destination"" and the IPID for a given destination can be inferred consistently enough to facilitate an attack. This allows DNS poisoning on IPv4 and IPv6 with equal consistency and precision, and makes poisoning on the first attempt ""thousands"" of times easier.

This talk will cover how this attack is carried out, how consistent it really can be, and mitigations that can be put in place by operators of both DNS nameservers and resolvers to limit its effectiveness.","Travis (Travco) Palmer Travis (Travco) Palmer is a Security Research Engineer at Cisco.
